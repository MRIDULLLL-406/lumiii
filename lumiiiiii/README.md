The Smart Companion solves the problem of executive function challenges faced by neurodivergent individuals, including people with ADHD, Autism, and Dyslexia.
Many users struggle with task paralysis, time blindness, decision fatigue, and difficulty processing dense text. Even simple tasks like “Clean the room” or “Finish an assignment” can feel overwhelming because the brain finds it hard to plan, initiate, and organize actions.
This app reduces overwhelm by breaking large tasks into small, manageable “Micro-Wins” that users can complete step-by-step in a structured and supportive way.
The purpose of building The Smart Companion is to bridge the executive function gap using AI-powered task decomposition.


The app aims to:
Convert overwhelming goals into simple, actionable steps
Provide a minimalist, single-task interface to reduce distraction
Support dyslexic-friendly typography (OpenDyslexic / Lexend fonts)
Offer micro-rewards and celebrations to boost motivation
Store user preferences securely with a privacy-first approach
Reduce dependence on caregivers for daily task management
The ultimate goal is to increase autonomy, confidence, and independence for neurodivergent individuals.
